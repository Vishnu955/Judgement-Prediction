## Abstract
The major problems that senior attorneys or any law 
firm face is managing thousands of legal cases in a  year. 
While many of the cases are accepted a significant portion 
of the cases must be denied as they are  more likely to be 
dismissed by the court for various reasons. Manually 
reviewing thousands of cases consumes lot of valuable time 
and resources and it also diverts the attention from cases 
with a higher chance of success. This project aims to 
address this issue by developing an AI-based model to 
automate the case filtering process, predicting the 
likelihood of a court rejecting or accepting an appeal or 
petition. In this project I am planning propose a standard 
BERT model which is a cutting-edge natural language 
processing framework, and the model will be trained on the 
IndianKanoon dataset, which has been manually created 
to include legal documents and case outcomes, using the 
collected data efficiently summarize the case files and use 
these summarized case files along with the entire data to 
train the model. By learning from this dataset, the model 
can identify patterns that indicate the probable rejection of 
a case. To validate the decisions made by the model I will 
be using Explainable AI techniques. To compare the 
modelâ€™s performance, I will be implementing LLAMA 3.2 
and GEMINI model using API this helps to ensure the 
models accuracy and effectiveness in real-world legal 
applications. This project is expected to help law firms and 
senior attorneys optimize their case management 
processes and to reduce the time spent on cases unlikely to 
succeed. By improving efficiency, the model offers a 
practical solution to a widespread problem in the legal 
field, benefiting both legal professionals and their clients.
